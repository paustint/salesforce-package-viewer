# Salesforce Package Viewer

This repository is for a Chrome extension to display second generation packages.

This is generally useful if you are developing a managed package and want a way for folks to see all the package version without going directly to Salesforce.

This requires users to have access to the devhub org or partner business org where the package is hosted.
